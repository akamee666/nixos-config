# My NixOS config

Here lies the configuration of my working/studying setup using NixOS. This config is for a single host (for now) which is my desktop.

I'm not enterely sure but i think it requires flakes, i'm still unsure how do i use flakes tbh.

## Disclamer

I'm completely new to nix/nixOS. I migrate from Arch (btw) weeks ago and this is my first config, so i'm not sure you that is reading it should use it if you also don't know what you doing :p

In this case, this will be better for you, take it: [starter config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs)

"I don't care i'll use yours anyway fuck it"

Ok then, have fun and if you have any questions feel free to contact me somewhere so i can *try* to help you!!
